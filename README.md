## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 18.x or higher recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Setup & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    *   You'll need to add your Google AI API key for Genkit to work:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
        ```
    *   You can obtain a Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the Genkit development server (for AI flows):**
    In a separate terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for auto-reloading on changes
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This starts the Genkit development server, typically on port 4000, making the AI flows available.

5.  **Run the Next.js development server:**
    In another terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js application, usually on `http://localhost:9002`.

6.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` to see the application.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## ü§ñ AI Features Explained

AlignMate leverages Genkit to interact with Google's Gemini models for its AI capabilities.

1.  **Generate Resume (`generate-resume.ts`)**
    *   **Input:** Structured data from the resume form (`GenerateResumeInput`).
    *   **Process:** The AI acts as an expert resume writer. It takes the user's raw data, refines the language, uses action verbs, quantifies achievements where appropriate, ensures professional tone, incorporates general ATS-friendly keywords, and formats it into a clean, plain text resume.
    *   **Output:** A string containing the generated plain text resume (`GenerateResumeOutput`).

2.  **Optimize Resume (`optimize-resume.ts`)**
    *   **Input:** Raw text of an existing resume (`OptimizeResumeInput`).
    *   **Process:** The AI reformats and optimizes the provided text, focusing on ATS-friendly structure, professional formatting, action verbs, and relevant keywords.
    *   **Output:** An object containing the optimized resume text (`OptimizeResumeOutput`).

3.  **Tailor Resume & ATS Checker (`tailor-resume.ts`)**
    *   **Input:** The current resume text and a job description (`TailorResumeInput`).
    *   **Process:**
        *   The AI deeply analyzes the job description to extract key skills, technologies, responsibilities, and company culture cues.
        *   It then rewrites/reorganizes the resume to highlight alignment with these specific requirements, integrating keywords naturally and concisely.
        *   Simultaneously, it generates a review object.
    *   **Output:** An object (`TailorResumeOutput`) containing:
        *   `tailoredResume`: The new, job-description-specific plain text resume.
        *   `review`: An object with:
            *   `strengths`: Strengths of the resume against the job description (bullet points).
            *   `weaknesses`: Weaknesses/gaps (bullet points).
            *   `atsScore`: Estimated ATS score (0-100%).
            *   `readability`: Brief readability assessment.
            *   `keywordMatchRate`: Estimated keyword match rate (0-100%).
            *   `suggestions`: Actionable improvement suggestions (bullet points).

## üé® UI & Styling

*   **ShadCN UI:** Provides a set of beautifully designed and accessible components that can be easily customized.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Used for utility-first styling, allowing for rapid UI development and easy maintenance.
*   **Theming:** Dark and Light modes are supported through CSS variables defined in `src/app/globals.css` and managed by `next-themes`.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Ideas)
